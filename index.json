Our analysis of the MLU in CDS, family-, and experimenter-directed ADS found significant differences between CDS and ADS_Fam, and between ADS_Fam and ADS_Exp, but not between CDS and ADS_Exp. Our finding suggests that researchers should pay more attention to controlling the level of formality in CDS and ADS when comparing the two registers for their speech characteristics.

Specifically, we explore whether the frequency and acoustic saliency of sound symbolic words are modulated by the maturity of children’s linguistic ability. A total of 36 infant-mother dyads, 12 each belonging to the three groups of preverbal (M = 8-month-old), early speech (M = 13-month-old), and multiword (M = 27-month-old) stage, were recorded in a 40-min free-play session. The results were consistent with the findings in previous research that the ratio of sound symbolic words in mothers’ speech decreases with child age and that they are acoustically more salient than conventional words in duration and pitch measures. We additionally found that mothers weaken the prominence for ideophones for older children in mean pitch, suggesting that such prominence of these iconic words might bootstrap infants’ word learning especially when they are younger. Interestingly, however, we found that mothers maintain the acoustic saliency of expressive lengthening consistently across children’s ages in all acoustic measures. There is some indication that children at age 2 are not likely to have mastered the fine details of scalar properties in certain words. Thus, it could be that they still benefit from the enhanced prosody of expressive lengthening in learning the semantic attributes of scalar adjectives, and, accordingly, mothers continue to provide redundant acoustic cues longer for expressive lengthening than ideophones.","tags":[],"title":"Korean Mothers Attune the Frequency and Acoustic Saliency of Sound Symbolic Words to the Linguistic Maturity of Their Children","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinyoung Jo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488931200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488931200,"objectID":"5ad2382aeeb8d6fccdd6fef49c897fb6","permalink":"/talk/gwanpojigyo/","publishdate":"2021-01-02T13:21:13-08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/gwanpojigyo/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Jo, J.

Using spontaneous speech data of six mother-child dyads (Demuth et al. 2006), I examined how word-medial /t/ and /d/ in the flapping environment were realized in suffixed words such as eating (base: eat) and hiding (base: hide). The results show that children indeed produced suffixed words with variants that are faithful to the corresponding segment in the base (e.g., ea[t]ing and hi[d]ing), especially in earlier stages of learning. Such characteristic speech of children cannot be fully explained by the influence of the input data that they receive from their caregivers. Thus, I conclude that children’s production of variants that are phonologically similar to the base is due to highly ranked output-to-output faithfulness constraints at the initial state of learning. Based on a set of OT constraints, the children’s grammar is modeled with maximum entropy grammar (Goldwater and Johnson 2003).","tags":[],"title":"Learning bias of phonological alternation in children learning English","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinyoung Jo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598141193,"objectID":"e6d4f45f715e5063f1888ac28338f39f","permalink":"/publication/jo-2016/","publishdate":"2020-08-23T00:15:18.063395Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jo-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Native and non-native English speakers' production of voiceless stops: Effects of lexical stress and prosodic domain on VOT.
