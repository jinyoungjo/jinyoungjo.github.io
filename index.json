We particularly focus on the impact of prosody on comprehension of restrictive relative clauses (RRC) and non-restrictive relative clauses (NRC) in Korean, a language that lacks morphosyntactic or orthographic markers that distinguish between RRC and NRC. We hypothesize that narrow focus prosody may be associated with RRC, while broad focus prosody with NRC, which we test in two experiments through a picture selection task (Experiment 1) and an audio selection task (Experiment 2). Results showed that Korean listeners associated narrow focus prosody more often with RRC-biased pictures than NRC-biased pictures, suggesting that prosodic information has an impact on the resolution of syntactic ambiguity in the absence of any explicit linguistic marker. Further investigation suggests that there is variation in the impact of prosody across individuals and their sensitivity to prosody seems to be affected differently depending on the type of task.","tags":[],"title":"What prosody does when morphosyntax is absent: the case of Korean relative clauses.

In addition to the child-directed speech (CDS), this corpus includes two different formalities of adult-directed speech (ADS), i.e., family-directed ADS (ADS_Fam) and experimenter-directed ADS (ADS_Exp). Our analysis of the MLU in CDS, family-, and experimenter-directed ADS found significant differences between CDS and ADS_Fam, and between ADS_Fam and ADS_Exp, but not between CDS and ADS_Exp. Our finding suggests that researchers should pay more attention to controlling the level of formality in CDS and ADS when comparing the two registers for their speech characteristics. The corpus was transcribed in the CHAT format of the CHILDES system, so users can easily extract data related to verbal behavior in the motherâ€“child interaction using the CLAN program of CHILDES.","tags":[],"title":"Introducing the Ko Corpus of Korean Motherâ€“Child Interaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew Faytak","Jake Aziz","Phillip Barnett","Jinyoung Jo","Jennifer Kuo","Gabriel Teixeira","Joy Wu","Z.L.

Specifically, we explore whether the frequency and acoustic saliency of sound symbolic words are modulated by the maturity of childrenâ€™s linguistic ability. A total of 36 infant-mother dyads, 12 each belonging to the three groups of preverbal (M = 8-month-old), early speech (M = 13-month-old), and multiword (M = 27-month-old) stage, were recorded in a 40-min free-play session. The results were consistent with the findings in previous research that the ratio of sound symbolic words in mothersâ€™ speech decreases with child age and that they are acoustically more salient than conventional words in duration and pitch measures. We additionally found that mothers weaken the prominence for ideophones for older children in mean pitch, suggesting that such prominence of these iconic words might bootstrap infantsâ€™ word learning especially when they are younger. Interestingly, however, we found that mothers maintain the acoustic saliency of expressive lengthening consistently across childrenâ€™s ages in all acoustic measures. There is some indication that children at age 2 are not likely to have mastered the fine details of scalar properties in certain words. Thus, it could be that they still benefit from the enhanced prosody of expressive lengthening in learning the semantic attributes of scalar adjectives, and, accordingly, mothers continue to provide redundant acoustic cues longer for expressive lengthening than ideophones.","tags":[],"title":"Korean Mothers Attune the Frequency and Acoustic Saliency of Sound Symbolic Words to the Linguistic Maturity of Their Children","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinyoung Jo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488931200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488931200,"objectID":"5ad2382aeeb8d6fccdd6fef49c897fb6","permalink":"/talk/gwanpojigyo/","publishdate":"2021-01-02T13:21:13-08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/gwanpojigyo/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Jo, J.

Using spontaneous speech data of six mother-child dyads (Demuth et al. 2006), I examined how word-medial /t/ and /d/ in the flapping environment were realized in suffixed words such as eating (base: eat) and hiding (base: hide). The results show that children indeed produced suffixed words with variants that are faithful to the corresponding segment in the base (e.g., ea[t]ing and hi[d]ing), especially in earlier stages of learning. Such characteristic speech of children cannot be fully explained by the influence of the input data that they receive from their caregivers. Thus, I conclude that childrenâ€™s production of variants that are phonologically similar to the base is due to highly ranked output-to-output faithfulness constraints at the initial state of learning. Based on a set of OT constraints, the childrenâ€™s grammar is modeled with maximum entropy grammar (Goldwater and Johnson 2003).","tags":[],"title":"Learning bias of phonological alternation in children learning English","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinyoung Jo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598141193,"objectID":"e6d4f45f715e5063f1888ac28338f39f","permalink":"/publication/jo-2016/","publishdate":"2020-08-23T00:15:18.063395Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jo-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Native and non-native English speakers' production of voiceless stops: Effects of lexical stress and prosodic domain on VOT.
